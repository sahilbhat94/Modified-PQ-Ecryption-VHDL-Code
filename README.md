# Modified-PQ-Ecryption-VHDL-Code

This file contains the VHDL Code of R-LWE(Ring Learnig With Errors) post quantum encryption scheme. The actual code has been modified so that it can support the university hardware API specifications.

Note: The original code of the R LWE belongs to the author at Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum. The code has been modified to our requirements so that it can be tested on our project.
